<h1 align="center">Fullstack CRUD Application - Platform For Managing Students and Campuses</h1>


<h2 align="center">Goal</h1>
Using Node, Express, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize, build a RESTful full-stack web application to manage students and campuses. This will cover all of the CRUD operations such as Creation, Reading, Updating, and Deletion. This will encompass models, querying a database with an ORM, designing routes/endpoints and handler functions to process user requests and generate responses, writing out React Components, managing the state of the application with React-Redux, and much more. This will also involve having two individual repositories/applications (a separate server and a separate client), which encourages separation of concerns and modularity.
